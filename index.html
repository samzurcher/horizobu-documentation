						<p>Started in 2008 as an experimental search engine, horizobu
							provides search and exploration services based on algorithmic and
							social community concepts with special focus on the organization
							and sharing of search results. Automatic and semantic suggestions
							for the refinement of search queries make horizobu especially
							well suited for mobile devices.</p>

						<p>An excerpt from the project description from 2010:</p>
						<blockquote>
							Starting with only a few search terms, horizobu suggests
							additional search terms and with a few mouse clicks, you will
							find what you are looking for. Instead of providing thousand of
							results, horizobu will show you a limited number of relevant
							results. Unlike common search engines, you can delete irrelevant
							results, save relevant results and share these results with
							friends. horizobu is a hybrid search engine based on well known
							algorithmic concepts and new community concepts. horizobu helps
							you to find and discover information. horizobu is different from
							common search engines in several aspects:
							<ul>
								<li>horizobu widens your horizon and offers new surprising
									insights.</li>
								<li>horizobu assists you in refining your search and
									reduces the chance of missing important information.</li>
								<li>horizobu interacts with you in your language and
									assists you in making correct choices.</li>
								<li>horizobu offers a new search engine interface paradigm
									and allows you to collect and self-manage your results.</li>
								<li>horizobu invites you to share your search experience
									with your friends all over the world.</li>
							</ul>
						</blockquote>
						<p>In the summer of 2014, the experimental project horizobu
							has come to an end. Besides the development of the system that is
							powering horizobu, we have as well executed an evaluation study
							with 75 people. We investigated whether the suggested tags are
							really helping the users to refine their search queries. The
							study showed that users with good to high information retrieval
							skills are better supported by horizobu compared to traditional
							search engine such as Google. Users with lower information
							retrieval skill preferred the significantly simpler user
							interface of Google and are not worried about information that
							they will possibly miss. Horizobuâ€™s sharing feature was rarely
							used. It seems that it takes time for users to understand that
							sharing of a search process can be beneficial to them and their
							peers.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="idea">
						<p>The idea on which horizobu is based on was developed in
							2008 based on an analysis of the major flaws of the existing
							information retrieval systems such as Google. The following two
							flaws were identified:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Search engines such as Google have access to more and
								more information. The results presented to the users are
								customized based on geographic location, data from social
								networks, search history, and other user-specific factors. This
								leads to search results that are better tailored towards the
								need of the individual user. Said differently, the user sees
								only information that reinforces his own opinion; contradicting
								information is filtered out and therefore the user is presented
								only a partial picture.</li>
							<li>For a long time, the information retrieval research
								community has identified users as the bottleneck. Often, users
								are using an insufficient amount of query terms or query terms
								that are not specific enough. As a consequence, search engines
								have often not enough information to define a result set that is
								relevant for the user. Even though there has been a lot of
								progress in the area of search engines, search engines are not
								getting into a conversation with their users.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The idea of horizobu is to not only return precise results
							but rather show as well related topics that might be interesting
							and relevant for the user. Therefore, horizobu is not a
							traditional search engine but rather an exploration engine. The
							user should not be required to think deeply about which search
							terms to use but rather start a conversation with horizobu. In a
							later stage, horizobu was extended to allow sharing of search
							results and therefore enabling a collaborative search process.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="concepts">
						<p>The most commonly used methods for providing access to a
							collection of information are based on two principles. Firstly,
							the categorization of information by experts (e.g. libraries) and
							secondly, the use of an algorithmically generated index (e.g.
							traditional search engines such as Google). Systems based on
							categorization use a centralized approach. Subject experts
							determine which keywords and categories are to be used. The
							categories provided by e.g. Yahoo are an example for such a
							system. To a certain degree, information available on wikipedia
							is as well categorized by subject experts. An advantage of a
							system based on categorization is that a subject expert has
							checked the content of a document and has assigned a
							categorization based on human brain power. But at the same time,
							this approach can as well be a disadvantage. Subject experts,
							e.g. librarians, will categorize documents based on their subject
							knowledge and often use subject specific terms. In order to be
							able to use such a categorization, the user has to have knowledge
							of the subject specific knowledge that the person creating the
							categorization, e.g. the librarians, has. Based on that
							observation, horizobu is using the tagging of content by users
							done on Web 2.0 services; amongst others data from services such
							as YouTube, flickr, or delicious. Users will use their language
							to tag content and are therefore closer to the normal search
							engine user than e.g. a librarian. During the development of
							horizobu, we designed and executed a study which showed that user
							generated tags are highly relevant for information retrieval.
							There is high probability that a tag of a relevant document is
							matched by a query term. Firstly, because tags are often not in a
							subject language but rather in the language used by a user in her
							daily life. Secondly, for many social tagging services, there are
							many tags available for a single piece of information. One such
							example are books: A classic library index will contain only a
							couple of keywords whereas the same book will be tagged with many
							different keywords in a service such as LibraryThing.</p>
						<p>horizobu basically used the query terms as tags to retrieve
							information from social tagging services such as YouTube,
							delicious, or flickr. horizobu considers at the same time result
							pages and checks whether those pages have been tagged in social
							tagging systems. Amongst others, those tags are then used to
							provide suggested search terms to the user which he can then use
							to refine her search query.</p>
						<p>
							horizobu is as well using the publicly available wikipedia data.
							horizobu generates a set of tags for every wikipedia page; as an
							example the <a href="assets/G_sharp_major.txt">tags</a> for the
							wikipedia page <a
								href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_sharp_major">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_sharp_major</a>.
							Those tags are e.g. based on markup such as titles or bold text,
							on meta data of images or on external links. horizobu analyses as
							well the relationship between different wikipedia pages; e.g. two
							pages linking to each other are likely to be semantically related
							and therefore the concepts represented by the two pages are
							connected. Further, wikipedia disambiguation pages are playing an
							important role. The relationships presented by disambiguation
							pages can be used for the exploration part of horizobu; horizobu
							suggests query terms that are related to other aspects of the
							initial query and therefore starts a dialog with the user.
							Wikipedia articles contain external links which are, in most
							cases, carefully selected and contain relevant high quality
							information. horizobu is using those links and increases the
							relevance of those pages and their associated information
							accordingly. Compared to the PageRank algorithm, horizobu puts
							more emphasis on the semantic tagging by the users and less on
							the popularity of a web page.
						</p>
						<p>Algorithmic search engines such as Google are based on an
							full text index. For every given document, more or less all words
							are put into the index. Therefore, the index is seemingly
							complete and it looks as if such an index is better than a
							folksonomy. The completeness of the index can at the very same
							time be a disadvantage. Even though a word might occur in a
							document, it might not be a accurate description of the document.
							And there are many words, such as generic terms, that are not
							occurring in a document and are therefore not contained in a full
							text index. Tagging could be seen as a manual way of creating an
							index. Contrary to a full text index, the words in the index are
							created by humans. There will be less words in the index but most
							of those words will have a higher descriptive value.
							Additionally, generic terms and terms commonly used in a subject
							area will as well be part of the index created by a folksonomy.
							Even though a folksonomy of a social bookmarking service might be
							relatively small in size compared to a traditional index, it can
							still be better than a traditional full text index. As a
							consequence, horizobu is based on both a traditional algorithmic
							search based on a full text index and a folksonomy created by the
							communities of social bookmarking services. horizobu is using
							Yahoo BOSS as the algorithmic part of the search process and web
							2.0 services such as flickr, YouTube, and wikipedia for the
							folksonomy part.</p>
						<p>horizobu uses new principles as well for the ranking and
							the presentation of the results. There are many studies showing
							that users are only looking at the first couple of results.
							Therefore, it is explicitly our goal to not provide 1000 hits but
							rather restrict ourselves to 50 results per query. In order to
							improve the ranking of the results, we consider as well behavior
							of users on horizobu. Such behavior can be visiting of results,
							saving results for sharing or deleting of irrelevant results.
							Further, the ranking is adapted based on popularity on social
							services or when being mentioned as a link on wikipedia.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="user_interface">
						<p>horizobuâ€™s aim is to start a conversation with the user.
							For each search query, horizobu is generating approximately 3000
							tags. horizobu is selecting about a dozen tags out of those 3000
							tags using the TagRank algorithm. The selected tags are then
							offered to the user as possible refinements for her search query.
							As a result, the user doesnâ€™t have to invest a lot of time in
							carefully selecting her search terms but can rather start a
							conversation with the search engine and iteratively and
							interactively refine the query. The picture below shows the tag
							cloud for the query ebooks teaching.</p>
						<img alt="Horizobu Tag Cloud" src="images/horizobu_tag_cloud.jpg"
							class="img-responsive">
						<p>By using context-based suggestions for possible search
							terms, horizobu is informing the user about other relevant
							contexts of a search query. These contexts are often not
							mentioned in the case of precision oriented search processes.
							Therefore, horizobu is not only helping with search but as well
							expanding the horizon of the user. This is especially relevant
							whenever the user doesnâ€™t know what he doesnâ€™t know.</p>
						<p>Most currently used search engines show the results in a
							fixed ranking which cannot be modified by the user. Itâ€™s neither
							possible to remove result nor save individual results for later
							use. From a usability point of view, a fixed ranking is contrary
							to how we search and select items in our daily lives. When
							looking through the mail, looking at vacation catalogues, or
							buying new glasses, we sort the items into two categories: good
							and bad. Vacation catalogues for destinations that we are not
							interested in are thrown into the paper pin immediately.
							Catalogues of destinations that might be relevant are put aside
							for later consideration. We repeat this procedure iteratively
							until we have found the destination of our liking. horizobuâ€™s
							user interface is based on this paradigm: search results can be
							deleted or put onto a pin wall so that they can looked at again
							later. A user can further save a pin wall for later use or for
							sharing with other users.</p>
						<img alt="Horizobu Search Results"
							src="images/horizobu_search_results.jpg" class="img-responsive">
						<p>It was not the goal of the horizobu team to be in
							competition with Google. Our priority was to explore new
							approaches in information retrieval. We are convinced that the
							quality of the tag suggestions and the results could be improved
							substantially with additional resources.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="tab-pane" id="implementation">
						<p>The implementation of horizobu consists of two parts.
							Firstly, an offline extraction and calculation of tags and
							secondly, a system to support user requests in real time.</p>
						<h3>Data Extraction and Calculation</h3>
						<p>The intelligence of horizobu is based on semi structured
							information retrieved from social information systems. Some of
							those systems provide APIs to retrieve that data, e.g. flickr or
							youtube, so no data extraction and calculation is necessary.</p>
						<p>For Wikipedia on the other side, only the raw data is
							available and the relevant information has to be extracted. We
							extensively extracted information from the raw Wikipedia source
							for several language versions, e.g. for every page:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>bold words</li>
							<li>italic words</li>
							<li>words contained in the name of the page or in one of the
								titles</li>
							<li>image names</li>
							<li>words used in links pointing to a page</li>
							<li>words used in category links</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Every extracted tag is assigned a normalized weight which
							is based on several properties of the page.</p>
						<p>The extraction is implemented with the help of Hadoop and
							is run on AWS with the raw wikipedia source on S3. The
							computation runs for several hours using a smallish Hadoop
							cluster. As output, the extraction writes for every wikipedia
							page a small file to S3. The file name is a hash of the
							normalized page name of the wikipedia page. The file itself
							contains all computed tags including weights and from which
							source (e.g. bold or title) the tags are calculated. An example
							of such a file can be found at [TODO link to such a file].</p>
						<h3>Real Time User Request System</h3>
						<p>This system is responsible for serving all the information
							for users using horizobu.com. It consists of four parts:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Static Frontend</li>
							<li>Dynamic Frontend</li>
							<li>Backend</li>
							<li>Session storage and caching</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Horizobu is hosted on AWS and each of those logical parts
							is deployed to a separate machine. For each part, at least one
							machine is needed but the system is designed in such a way that
							it can be horizontally scaled for each part. The JavaScript is
							implemented with Google Closure Library and JQuery. Both the
							backend and the frontend are developed in Java and running in a
							Tomcat container.</p>
						<h4>Static Frontend</h4>
						<p>The static frontend is the only machine reachable from the
							internet and is responsible for serving static resources such as
							images, CSS, or JavaScript using nginx. Further, it proxies any
							dynamic requests to the dynamic frontend.</p>
						<h4>Dynamic Frontend</h4>
						<p>The dynamic frontend is responsible for requesting the
							calculation of the data from the backend and enhancing and
							transforming that data based on logic that is session and
							presentation dependent. One such transformation is to make sure
							that tags in the tag cloud are ordered in a consistent way across
							multiple search requests in the same session.</p>
						<p>The user session consists only of an identifier and all
							relevant information about the user context is requested from the
							session storage and caching layer. E.g. the last seen tag cloud
							is stored in this session storage layer.</p>
						<p>The frontend can be scaled horizontally as no user
							information is stored in the frontend itself.</p>
						<h4>Backend</h4>
						<p>The backend is responsible for retrieving the raw data and
							calculating both the tag cloud and the results from it. The raw
							data is retrieved from multiple services in parallel. Yahoo BOSS
							is called several times with different filters and the results
							are used both for the result calculation and as an input for the
							tag calculation. Several social information systems are queried
							for tags and links and tags and links from the previously
							extracted wikipedia data is as well used. The results are
							weighted and combined and a ranking is defined. The tags are as
							well weighted based on several factors and then reduced to a tag
							set of around 40 tags making sure that we have a diverse set of
							tags.</p>
						<p>The backend is completely session independent and returns
							both tags and results independent of the user. The backend can be
							scaled horizontally and it is made sure that for a specific user
							query, always the same backend is queried and therefore local
							caches can be used.</p>
						<h4>Session Storage and Caching Layer</h4>
						<p>Based on memcached, stores both session information and
							caches requests to external services. Key schema designed in such
							a way that it can be scaled horizontally.</p>

						<p>Werner Hartmann and Sam Zurcher have known each other for a
							long time. They first met in 1997 at High School Baden where
							Werner Hartmann was a math teacher and Sam Zurcher was a student.
							They then met again at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
							in Zurich where Werner Hartmann was a professor for computer
							science and Sam Zurcher was a computer science student. Sam
							Zurcher studied at UNC Chapel Hill for a year, was an intern at
							Google in Mountain View, CA, and spent a year working as an ICT
							consultant in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. In 2008, they met
							again. The idea behind horizobu was born during a dinner at a
							local pizza place. A couple of emails later, the idea started
							taking shape and a first very basic prototype followed soon
							after. A bit later, a second prototype followed and made use of
							publicly available cloud infrastructure. The second prototype was
							used to convince people and soon our team had grown to more
							people; among them somebody with a lot of knowledge in the area
							of the wikipedia.</p>
						<img alt="People" src="images/horizobu_people.jpg"
							class="img-responsive">
						<p>In fall 2009, three young designers from Berlin joined the
							team and in the beginning of 2010, horizobu was joined by a
							lawyer who was taking care of the legal side of things.
							Approximately a dozen people have been working since then in
							their free time on horizobu. A German beta version went online in
							fall 2010 and has been continuously improved since. In summer
							2014 the experimental project horizobu has been closed.</p>
